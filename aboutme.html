								<h2>Who I Am</h2>
								<p>
									I'm a largely self-taught programmer who is always motivated to learn new skills. I began to homeschool in the sixth grade, when my mother
									enrolled me in a game development course at the New England Sports Academy in Westwood, Massachusetts. This course introduced me to C++ using
									the DarkGDK framework, and later introduced me to C# with Unity3D. After I stopped attending the course, I often spent time in Barnes & Noble's
									programming section to further my knowledge with these two languages, as well as to help me learn other programming languages I was not familiar
									with. Learning new technologies is still something I enjoy doing to this day, with my most recent example being having learned JavaScript.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am also an advocate for public transportation, as it helps mitigate the need to have cars on the road, which reduces gasoline emissions and is
									often a convenient way to get to important areas of a city from its outer areas and suburbs. The large capacity of trains and buses is something
									that I believe can lead to a positive environmental impact, while lessening traffic on the roads for people who either need to drive in order
									to reach their destinations.
								</p>

								<h2>Things that Motivate Me</h2>

								<p>
									A major motivation for me is believing that my work has a notable impact on the audience I reach, be it in terms of entertainment, productivity,
									or communication. This was a major reason why one of my older projects, <a href="http://www.byond.com/games/Vexxen/PUN">Pokémon Universe
									Network</a>, recieved development for as long as I did, as it fulfilled a small niche that brought Pokémon fans joy.
								</p>

								<p>
									Accessibility is also something that greatly motivates me, as issues that a person has should not inhibit their ability to use a service. Due
									to this, I try to keep accessibility at the forefront of anything I design as it should be a requirement in newly designed products.
								</p>
								<h2>Misc. Hobbies</h2>
								<p>
									I love to brew coffee and tea, and experiment with how I create the coffee or tea and what I pair it with. Homemade Cold Brew is a specialty of
									mine because of this, and I enjoy using my Chemex brewer most of all.
